Keras is an open-source Python framework for deep learning that can run on top of other deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK. With high-level APIs, easy-to-use, and easy-to-extend features, Keras helps users build deep learning models in a simple way.

To use Keras for image classification, we can follow these steps:
Import the necessary libraries
Load the MNIST dataset
Reshape the data to the format required by Keras
One-hot encode the label
Define the model with layers stacked on top of each other
Compile the model, specifying the loss function and optimization method
Train the model with the data
Evaluate the accuracy of the model on the test data
Plot the graph representing the changes in the loss function and accuracy during training and validation
Predict an image
A detailed example can be found in the code above.
