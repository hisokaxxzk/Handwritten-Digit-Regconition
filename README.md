Keras is an open-source Python framework for deep learning that can run on top of other deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK. With high-level APIs, easy-to-use, and easy-to-extend features, Keras helps users build deep learning models in a simple way.

To use Keras for image classification, we can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries

2. Load the MNIST dataset

3. Reshape the data to the format required by Keras

4. One-hot encode the label

5. Define the model with layers stacked on top of each other

6. Compile the model, specifying the loss function and optimization method

7. Train the model with the data

8. Evaluate the accuracy of the model on the test data

9. Plot the graph representing the changes in the loss function and accuracy during training and validation

10. Predict an image

A detailed example can be found in the file 'main.py'.
